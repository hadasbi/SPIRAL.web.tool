    "In the Azure portal:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFollow the tutorial to create a VM. The current deployment uses a Standard E20as v5 (20 vcpus, 160 GiB memory).\n",

    "**Important:** before beginning the installation, make sure that all the disks are allocated and mounted. The current deployment uses a 1T disk that is used for both the OS and data. However, the more \"correct\" way is to use a small (32G) OS disk, and a larger (let's say 1T) Data disk. In this case, you should mount the Data disk on some folder, let's say `/var2`, and then create a symbolic link from `/var` to `/var2`.\n",

    "\n",
    "•\t`lsblk` shows the physical disks and whether they are partitioned and mounted. So if there is \"sdb\" for example but it is not divided to \"sdb1\", \"sdb14\" etc., then it is not partitioned. If it is divided, but for example \"sdb1\" has nothing under \"MOUNTPOINTS\", then it is not mounted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "•\t`df -h` shows the actual attached disks (and the available space). So make sure that the \"SIZE\" fits what you expect.\n"
