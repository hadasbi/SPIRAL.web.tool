# SPIRAL
SPIRAL is an algorithm that relies on a Gaussian statistical model to produce a comprehensive overview of significant
processes in single cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics or bulk RNA-seq. SPIRAL detects biological processes by
identifying the subset of genes involved and the subset of cells, spots or samples.

SPIRAL is available as a web interface at https://spiral.technion.ac.il/ (currently only available in the Technion).
You can also run SPIRAL locally by downloading the repository, and then run SPIRAL_local_run.py.

## How to easy run the SPIRAL algorithm on your data locally
To execute the SPIRAL algorithm on your data locally, bypassing the need to utilize the webtool, simply employ the SPIRAL_Local_run.py script. 
This convenient tool facilitates running the algorithm directly on your local data.

1. Run the script using the command 
    ```sh 
    python SPIRAL_Local_run.py.
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to input necessary parameters and data.
